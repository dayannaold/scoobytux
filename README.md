### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Tu.

My major is Computer Engineering which primarily focuses on electrical/electronicsâ€‘related courses. However, I have switched my career
path to Web Development where I found building beautiful, useful and scalable web applications that resolve customersâ€™ problems very
interesting.

I am currently learning frontâ€‘end web technologies.
